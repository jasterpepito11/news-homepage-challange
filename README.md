## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Further learned how to use flex, flex-wrap, block in relation to each other in
a much more efficient way. Took advantage of the existing classes that tailwind
already provides.


### Continued development
I would like to continue working with my UI/UX challenges and slowly take more challenging
exercises as I go forward

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me for easily styling my UI. I really like that it is not too opinionated with its design compared to other CSS frameworks.
